# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project ~ Sivabalan

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project! This project is a part of my Data Science learning journey, focusing on analyzing and visualizing datasets to extract meaningful insights. EDA is a crucial step in any data-driven project as it helps to understand the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and establish relationships between variables.

This project is open for others to explore, use, or contribute to, and aims to provide a comprehensive guide for beginners and practitioners alike.

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves using statistical and visualization techniques to better understand a dataset. This project will showcase different steps involved in EDA such as:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and fixing data types.
- Descriptive Statistics: Understanding distributions, means, medians, and standard deviations.
- Data Visualization: Creating graphs like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new variables from existing data.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this EDA project are:
- To explore the dataset in-depth and understand the relationships between variables.
- To clean and preprocess the data to make it ready for modeling.
- To generate visual insights that can guide further decision-making or modeling.
